# Adobe Analytics Demo - Iframe App

This is the micro-frontend application that gets loaded inside an iframe by the main GFD app. It demonstrates cross-origin analytics tracking using the shared analytics package.

## Features

- Lightweight micro-frontend designed to be embedded in iframe
- Cross-origin analytics tracking via postMessage
- Shared analytics package integration
- Clean, focused UI with analytics demonstration

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

**Note:** This app is designed to be embedded in the main GFD app via iframe. For the full analytics demo experience, run both apps and access the main app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
